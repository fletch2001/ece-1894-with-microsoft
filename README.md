## Getting Started
We started the project off by reading:
* [Azure Sphere Quickstarts](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure-sphere/install/overview)
* [The Seven Properties of Highly Secured Devices](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SevenPropertiesofHighlySecureDevices.pdf)
* [Overview of Azure Sphere Applications](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure-sphere/app-development/applications-overview)

These are some really good resources written by some really good people who we got to work with over the course of the semester.


## What's in this repo
We made pretty good progress getting things started. A high-level only and high-level/real-time app are both set up within this repo. It's probably easier to learn Sphere with High Level apps as they really leverage the Sphere-y things that Microsoft has to offer. So far, we've collected one dryer load's worth of data and done quite a bit of processing on it. That stuff is in the azure-ml folder. 

We gave a presentation at the Microsoft Pittsburgh Office on April 26th, 2023. Our presentation is in our repository - [microsoft\ presentation\ 04262023.pdf]. It's a good visual overview of our architecture and what we have so far.

If you're interested in our project, or want to pick up where we left off, and you have any questions please reach out to us by our emails. I (Noah) am a Junior so I'll still be around and quite responsive to that email address for a while.
